#### Communication plan:
- Our group wil communicate primarily through Slack when not in the immediate area.  All new features and changes will be brought before the group so that everyone has their opinion heard as the project progresses.  Everyone will respect one another's personal psychological saftey.  

#### Conflict plan: 

- The best way to resolve conflicts are proactively so the group members will try to foresee anything that might cause a conflict with another member.  Should a conflict arrise, the group will try to resolve it amongst the group and if the issue is still not resolved then the group will involve a teacher or TA. 

#### Work plan: 

- Daily tasks will be broken up by feature and worked on in a separate feature branch.  We will write up and assign tasks using trello in order to track the progress and workflow of all team members.  If a member should encounter a road block or has an issue, they will request the assistance of another group member.  

#### Git process:
- What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that itâ€™s time to merge?
- All work will be done on feature branches and all pull requests will require the approval of another team member. Pull requests will first be done onto a development branch until MVP is obtained.  Once MVP is met, that will be pushed onto master and the group will then push for stretch goals.  

#### Any thing else you feel is important:

- The group will have a short pre-standup so that everyone is on track with each other prior to the standup w/ the teaching staff.  
- Any blockers should be brought before the group so that the group can be flexible enough to shift energy toward different features.
